# JavaScript API Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a JavaScript API Dashboard built as a single-page web application.  
It displays multiple mini apps in a responsive grid layout, with each section fetching and displaying data from a different public API.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of:
- Asynchronous JavaScript (`fetch`, `async/await`)
- Working with real-world APIs
- DOM manipulation
- Error handling and loading states
- Modular and organized JavaScript code

---

## Features
The dashboard includes **8 independent API-powered mini apps**:

1. 🐶 **Random Dog Image** – Fetches and displays a random dog image  
2. 🐱 **Random Cat Image** – Fetches and displays a random cat image  
3. 🤣 **Random Joke** – Displays a random joke (single or setup/delivery)  
4. 🧩 **Random Pokémon** – Shows a random Pokémon with image and stats  
5. 🌤️ **Toronto Weather** – Displays current weather data for Toronto  
6. 🌫️ **Toronto Air Quality** – Shows air quality metrics using AQI data  
7. 🌅 **Sunrise & Sunset** – Displays sunrise, sunset, and day length for Toronto  
8. 💱 **Currency Exchange Rates** – Displays CAD to USD and EUR exchange rates  

Each section works independently and includes loading and error handling.
